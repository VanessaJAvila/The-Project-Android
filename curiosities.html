            <h2>Curiosity 1</h2>
            <p>Did you know that artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to create deepfake videos? Deepfakes are highly realistic manipulated videos that can make it appear as though someone said or did something they didn't. This technology has both creative and potentially harmful implications.</p>

            <h2>Curiosity 2</h2>
            <p>Quantum computing is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize the world of technology. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for exponentially faster calculations and solving complex problems.</p>
