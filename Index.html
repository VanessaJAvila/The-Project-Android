            <h1>The History of the Android Mascot</h1>
            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used mobile operating systems worldwide. But did you know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very interesting story? Join us in this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>
            <h2>The First Version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (a free software for vector image editing) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was simply to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they were the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
            <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot kept evolving, and the task was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, took on the mission of representing the little robot in a more appealing way.</p>

                <img src="irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok, creator of the Bugdroid">
            </picture>
            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with a minimal number of strokes and a flat design. The illustration should also quickly generate identification with the viewer. Thus, the Bugdroid, the new Android mascot, was born.</p>
            <img src="bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid">
            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little figures that illustrate restroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was working at her desk in Google's office when she looked over at the restroom doors and had an epiphany: simplicity, cleanliness, and directness.</p>
